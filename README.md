# UK Public Body Spending

Councils in the UK are required to publish their spending over £500 as open data. The quality of the CSV files is far from perfect.

We have [a second repo that collates the files and cleans them](https://github.com/odileeds/council-spending-data). This uses the processed data into breakdowns by recipient.

## Structure

Each public body has a directory. Within each directory is a `summary.csv` file that gives a monthly summary (£) and the files that contain spending items within that month.
