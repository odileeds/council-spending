# UK Public Body Spending

Councils in the UK are required to publish their spending over £500 as open data. The quality of the CSV files is far from perfect.

This collates the files and cleans them. It then processes the data into monthly summaries and as breakdowns by recipient.

## Structure

Each public body has a directory. Within each directory is a `summary.csv` file that gives a monthly summary (£) and the files that contain spending items within that month.
